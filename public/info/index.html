<p>Hi! I&rsquo;m Wilson - a lawyer-turned-software developer.</p>
<p>In my past life, I practiced corporate/commercial law while owning and operating a firm alongside my business partner.</p>
<p>Now, I write software - mostly for embedded systems - and tinker with my personal projects.</p>
<h3 id="how-on-earth-did-that-happen">How on Earth did that happen?</h3>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>Tech has been a lifelong passion of mine. I still remember messing around with my family&rsquo;s Apple Macintosh Classic, trying to learn as much as possible about it.</p>

Endless hours were spent playing Shufflepuck Cafe on this thing.

<p>From there, the seed (no pun intended) was planted. I tried teaching myself HTML/CSS in the early days of the internet, then in high school I took courses on Turing as well as Visual Basic. While studying Business Administration in my undergrad, I would still take time to follow online tutorials when I found them. I liked the idea of making things that could do a bunch of other things.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years, I&rsquo;m now a full-fledged lawyer, and COVID hits. I&rsquo;m suddenly working from home and had a ton of extra time on my hands. I picked up a book I&rsquo;d been working through in my off-time (<a href="https://nostarch.com/python-crash-course-3rd-edition">Python Crash Course</a>) and powered through it. Looking to cut my teeth on something more, I found <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/python-for-everybody/">FreeCodeCamps&rsquo; Python course</a> and finished that as well.</p>
<p>At this point I was in a sort of limbo. I felt that I had a good understanding of the core concepts of Python, but I wanted to learn more. I looked at bootcamps, but realized they focused more on front-end development while I wanted a deeper understanding of how computers and software actually worked. Then I looked at part-time/evening courses at colleges and universities, at which point I thought: &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m going to go back to school, why do it half-way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was quickly followed by another thought: &ldquo;Because you work full-time in a career already&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t an easy decision - I don&rsquo;t know that career changes ever are - but I realized that I would regret it if I didn&rsquo;t try something that - on review - I clearly had a lifelong interest in.</p>
<p>And that pretty much sealed the deal. I charted my exit from the practice of law and started BCIT&rsquo;s CST program - a program with a reputation for a grueling workload. My favourite courses were on lower-level topics like Operating Systems, C, and Computer Architecture, from which my interest in embedded systems grew. I secured a spot in BCIT&rsquo;s Co-op program and a job as an Embedded Software Engineer at Sierra Wireless.</p>
<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m searching for the next opportunity to apply my passion and interest in software development.</p>
